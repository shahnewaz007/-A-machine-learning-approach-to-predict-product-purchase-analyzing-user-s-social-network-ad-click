# A machine learning approach to predict product purchase analyzing user's social network ad click

User interest and behavior modeling is a critical step in online digital advertising. As advertising strategy has become mostly dependent on online platform, choosing the right audiences is very important. It’s very disturbing for the users getting unusual ads even they aren’t interested about the product and also very costly for the companies targeting a large audience for advertisement without getting expected sale. Machine learning technique is a good way to analyze users’ interest, ability for a particular product as it can help determine the probability of an Ad viewer becoming a buying customer. Buying a product depends on a number of conditions or features of a user. Many people prefer to buy products by face to face. Also digital platform usage, financial condition, tradition, environment, age, etc. impacts a lot in this sector. In this research, we have used machine learning approaches to predict whether an audience will buy a product or not who has already clicked the advertisement analyzing different conditions of that user. Such as, age, online platform dependency, monthly income etc. Social media platform is one of the best way for product marketing as a huge number of potential customers use these platforms regularly. So we have used a dataset from a marketing agency who advertise their products in social Medias. Though online marketing has taken over the traditional marketing strategies and companies are warmly accepting this, the audience filtering system isn’t that much accurate yet. There is still a good chance to improve the accuracy to predict product buying by an audience. And this’ll help the companies a lot to target the right audiences for their product promotions and the internet users will not be disturbed getting unnecessary advertisement. By analyzing these matters, we have decided to work on this topic.

After data preprocessing and feature extraction tasks, we have gone through the following methods to implement the machine learning models. We have split the dataset into 0.7:0.3 for training and testing.

We have used a number of models on the data set to find the best result. Among them, we got 90% accuracy for Naive Bayes Algorithm. I think Decision Tree and Random Forest have shown 100% accuracy for data overfit. We have taken an approach to predict product purchase analyzing user’s data. We couldn’t collect a large number of data as advertisement companies aren’t willing to share user’s personal information to the public. So we couldn’t use Neural Network models for lack of large data set. Our future plan is to enlarge the data set and implement the deep learning models to get more accuracy so that our research can be used in the production level.
